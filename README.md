## Password Generator functionality

* User will have to declare the preferred amount of characters for the password before moving forward to the next step. The application will prompt to enter a number if letters were entered. The user will also have to enter a number no less than 8 and no more than 128. If these criterias are not met, the application will continue prompt the user to enter a number that satisfies the criteria, unless 'cancel' was selected.
